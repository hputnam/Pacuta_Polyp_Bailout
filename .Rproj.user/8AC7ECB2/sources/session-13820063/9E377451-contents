Protocol/Methods For First Bailout Experiment.
1. Assure the Setup is Correct. [Bailout Setup](https://github.com/Thatcher513/TJW_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-06-10-Bailout-Setup-Protocol.md)
2. Turn on incubator 24hrs before test day allowing the header tank to get to 25 degrees Celsius
3. Assure that the AI Lights are on and on schedule.
4. Check the Salinity of the Header Tank once it is up to temperature (60-63ppt)
5. Create 8 clippings of Pocillopora Acuta using Bone Clippers. Clippings should be 1-2cm long with 20-25 polyps.
6. Take pictures of each clipping.
7. Add 25 degree 35ppt saltwater from the same tank as the clippings into each chamber C1-C8.
8. Place clippings gently into each chamber make sure they are not touching walls or bubbler tips.
9. Attach Bubble tips and Input tubes to C1-C4 
10. Attach Bubble tips only to C5-C8 these will be control chambers salinity will stay constant. 
11. Close all chambers and plug in air pump
12. Let run for 20 hours after 20 hours check hourly for signs of bailout.
If they dont bailout use a small pipette to agitate the water around them.
13. Take pictures of coral skeleton after bailout.
14. Use dissecting microscope to determine the health of coral micropropogates.
