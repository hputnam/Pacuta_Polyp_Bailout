All of the setup is in a Thermo Scientific incubator set to 25 degrees Celsius
1. We used a organizing tray with 36 cells. Each cell has a height of 2.5cm a width of 3cm and a length of 4cm.
-Should have enough space to hold 23ml of water.

2. I used 2 trays and used only the 4 front facing cells from each tray. For a total of 8 test chambers.
3. In each test chamber inlet holes where drilled in the top with a 6mm drill bit. 
4. Air bubbler inlet holes where drill in the top with a 6mm drill bit.

5. Outlet holes drilled with a 5mm drill bit about 2/3 up the side wall. facing out.

7. Air bubbles used for mixing water. I attached a micro pipette tip to airline and put the tip in the chamber.
8. Air controlled with valves above every outlet tip.

9. Jebao DP4s where used to dose 1ml of water in every hour and to take 1ml out of the chamber after 10 minutes.

10. Aqua Illumination Hydra WiFi Led Lights where hung 28 cm above the chambers.

11. Calibrated to output 65-70 PAR. Below are the wavelength percentages.
